# HANDOFF — THE ONE PAGE every Claude works from (any account, any session)

Owner, 2026-10-23: "the handoff should be ONE — it is where all Claudes are working from". So: **rewrite the 🔁 NOW section in place at the
end of every session — never stack a new dated handoff on top.** Finished work → one line in `docs/FEELESS_HISTORY.md` (the end); the
open list → `CLAUDE.md › 📋 CURRENT TASKS`. Old stacked handoffs live in `docs/FEELESS_HISTORY.md › 📦 ARCHIVED HANDOFFS` (grep, never load).

Read this (2 min) → `CLAUDE.md` (lean rules + 🎨 MANDATORY STYLING + 📋 CURRENT TASKS) → `docs/DECISIONS.md` (before any money / custody work) → only the history lines your task touches
(`grep -n "<topic>" docs/FEELESS_HISTORY.md`).

> ⚡ EVERY SESSION (owner, 2026-10-15 — repeat in anything you hand off):
> 1. **Conserve usage.** grep first, read only the lines you need, batch commands, no essays, no re-reading files you just edited.
> 2. **Finish everything, in priority order.** When a new request lands mid-task, finish or hand off the current one — never leave a
>    surface half-organized or half-styled. FULLY redo what is asked (owner: "not half do, not some side shit").
> 3. **Never dead-style.** Before deleting CSS, confirm no component renders the class; every new box needs its rules in a sheet and a
>    LIVE visual (meters, bars, animation on real numbers), never bare text. `styles/cssCoverage.test.js` fails on an unstyled class.

## 🔁 NOW (rewrite this section in place every session)
**Updated 2026-10-23 (late night) · Opus 5.5** — the open list is `CLAUDE.md › 📋 CURRENT TASKS › P0`. Done today (grep the history for
"2026-10-23 night" / "late night"): ⚡ REAL LEVERAGE (Jupiter Lend Borrow, DECISIONS #7) · 📉 REAL PERPS on Jupiter (DECISIONS #8, `jup_perps.py`,
/familia/perps-real) · 🌉 BRIDGE + ⛽ GAS through LI.FI · 🕸 intake revived (DexScreener fallback when Jupiter's read key 429s) · 📌 the Agents
cockpit chart no longer swaps coins every poll · 🧠 OSSY / G4 stop chasing (PARABOLIC / spike entries refused) · 📉 the FEELESS PERPS terminal
(true candles, draggable TP / SL, Jupiter TP / SL + partial close) + ⏱ Kalshi $1 up / down (waits on the DFlow key). **Perps = `docs/PERPS.md`.**
Hyperliquid / gTrade / Drift bar US users — out. Agents: edge-audit GATE HOLD (0 / 753 rules positive on unseen coins), FeeCat paused (1 / 9
lives), NEXA 43 % — no agent is proven to make money; a top-up sits idle until one is. G4 runs Qwen3.5-4B on the desktop (10.0.0.249:1236, ONE
slot). Dev previews: `/dev/perps` (the perps dash on live markets) · `/dev/hq?snap` (the LIVE agents desk — copy `backend/data/agents_view.json` → `frontend/public/dev-agents.json`)
· `/dev/bridge` · `/dev/gas` · `/dev/nexa` · `/dev/hq?rpc` · `/dev/block`.
🔑 Jupiter: 3 keys → key 3 is the shared READ key for every price read sitewide and sits at 429 most of the day; the owner adding a 4th key
(portal.jup.ag → `JUPITER_READ_KEY`) frees it. The intake no longer depends on it.

Start of every task: `backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/cash-check.py degen 30` (≈ 1 min, sandbox off).
Branch: everything on `main`. Gate + push from `.claude/worktrees/gate` (`git checkout -q --detach <sha>`, then `git push origin <sha>:main`;
the pre-push hook runs the full gate ~8 min — run no tests beside it). Restart a service = kill its uvicorn PID; the keep-alive watcher relaunches it.
🚨 RPC: Helius + Alchemy were OUT OF QUOTA (2026-10-23) — the owner adds a key in HQ › Core › Lag catcher › 🔌 RPC LANES.

### Where today's work lives (frontend only; grep the history for "2026-10-23 evening")
- 🌆 Fee City METRO: `lib/cityPlan.js` (`METRO`, `KEYS`, `feePlan(v, mk, pools)`, `moneyShare` = 81 %) · `lib/cityEngine.js` (merged neon trims,
  `p.cars` budget, fog scales with the city) · `FeeCity3D.jsx` (`chipsOf`, money-first `Directory` + `DIR_GROUPS`, the `feeless:desk` host).
- 💸 `components/MoneyDesk.jsx` + `styles/moneyDesk.css`: `providersOf` (in-place only), `growth`, SAFE · DEGEN · MOON (`feeHunters`,
  `moonHunters`, `bandBoost`), `RangePicture`, `openDesk` (side panels open it over the map). Used by the family block pop-out
  (`FamilyBlock3D.BlockCard`), Fee City market / pool panels, the Pool Hub, FeeCat's combo.
- 🏙 Family block: `FamilyBlock3D` controls (☀ / 🌙 shared key `feeless.city.mode`, ⤢, 360°, ⌂) + `pop` over the stage; `errandGo` never links out.
- 💬 `StreetChat.jsx`: `BestStrip` (`bestCall`, `pumpHot`), starters, reconnecting line. 🐱 `catForge.css` (scope `.cfv`) + violet `createCat.css`
  + `StepRail`. 🚀 `launchFlow.css` + `STYLE_ART`, supply meter, `ReadyRing`. 📉 perps: `PerpsDash` (the room) → `RealPerps` (Jupiter ticket) + `PaperPerps` (🧪 practice).
- ⚖ `docs/COUNSEL_BRIEF.md` + DECISIONS #6.

### Gate + restart rules learned the hard way
- jest `--maxWorkers=4`; NEVER run tests while a gate runs; harden timing tests (poll, never a tight wall clock) — read the stack first.
- A test's fixture clock must be the real clock when the component reads `Date.now()` (a fixed future epoch silently expires later).
- Restart backend: no `pending` in fuse_wallet.db books → start the watcher FROM CLAUDE (`/usr/bin/python3 -c 'import os; os.setsid();
  os.execvp("bash", ["bash","scripts/background.sh","start"])'`, sandbox off) → kill the PID, let the watcher relaunch it → 1 copy + LAN ONLINE.
- Merging into main locally never restarts the backend — after a backend push, restart reputation_service yourself.
- Every cat `/action` call needs the cat's `ownerId` (the browser id, `FeeCatsPlatform` adds it) or the internal key — tests too.

## 1 · What this is
FEELESS = a Solana degen trading terminal. One owner, one REAL money card run by ten agents, plus a big site (trade, Fuse, Arena,
chats, FeeCat, Familia). Money rules are strict and tested — read `CLAUDE.md › Money rules` before touching anything that buys or sells.

## 2 · Run / check
| What | Command |
| --- | --- |
| backend tests | `PYTHONPATH=backend:. .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -q` |
| frontend tests | `cd frontend && CI=true yarn test --watchAll=false` (never bare `npx jest` — it lacks the babel config) |
| build | `cd frontend && CI=false npx craco build` |
| all gates (pre-push hook) | `bash scripts/gate.sh` |
| restart backend | see "Gate + restart rules" above; then `pgrep -f "uvicorn reputation_service" \| wc -l` must be 1 |
| real card cash | `backend/.venv/bin/python scripts/cash-check.py degen 30` (every task) |
| real card money trail | `.venv/bin/python scripts/fuse-report.py 6` |
| is there an edge? | `.venv/bin/python scripts/edge-audit.py` (run BEFORE advising on real-money buying) |

Services: `server` 5001 · `reputation_service` 5077 · `feecat_service` 5088 · `candles_service` 5099 · frontend 51367 (the owner's own dev
server — attach, never start a second). Push to `main`; the owner's Mac auto-pulls.

## 3 · Where things live (the files that matter most)
| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| agents (the real card) | `backend/agents.py` · `office.py` · `office_edge.py` · `trench_kernel/` · `opportunity.py` · `capital.py` |
| keeper (signs, sells, books) | `backend/fuse_wallet.py` · `arena_prime.py` (tier engine) |
| AI | `backend/ai_router.py` (providers, `with_studio`) · `prompt_studio.py` · `model_desk.py` · `ai_rig.py` · `ai_chat.py` (Brain) · `nexa_desk.py` |
| owner's LM Studio | `backend/feeless_mcp.py` (read-only MCP) · `docs/lm_fee_prompt.txt` · `docs/LM_STUDIO_MCP.md` · `docs/FEE_BRAIN.md` |
| big service | `backend/reputation_service.py` (31K lines — grep, never read whole) |
| Familia | `family_city.py` · `family_world.py` · `block_markets.py` → `FamilyWorld` → `FeeCity3D` (`lib/cityEngine.js` draws `lib/cityPlan.js`) · `FamilyBlock3D` · `FamiliaTrade.jsx` · `FamiliaApp.jsx` · `paper_perps.py` · `clmm_range.py` |
| FeeCat | `backend/feecat_service.py` · `feecat_brain.py` · `cat_model.py` · `cat_real.py` (real mode) → `components/feecat/` · `command/CatDesk.jsx` + `CatReal.jsx` |
| UI | `frontend/src/components/command/` (HQ) · `components/HomeEngine.jsx` · `styles/` (map in CLAUDE.md › CSS map) |

## 4 · How to work here (the owner's rules, short)
- Brief with the owner. Verdict, what changed, what was tested, what wasn't.
- Every money change ships with a test that fakes the network. Never hit mainnet or move funds.
- UI = m-* presets, transform / opacity only, day theme + fx-lite + reduced motion + 640px blocks.
- When you ship: tick it off `CLAUDE.md › CURRENT TASKS`, ONE line in `docs/FEELESS_HISTORY.md`, rewrite 🔁 NOW above.
- 🎨 Styling is MANDATORY (`CLAUDE.md › MANDATORY STYLING + ANIMATION`): drawn, alive, unique per page, a twist never a copy, screenshot it.
- Commit before long tasks (the update script auto-stashes uncommitted work). `git fetch` + rebase before pushing.
- Edge audit: still no rule positive on unseen coins — say so before any real-money advice.
