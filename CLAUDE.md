# FEELESS — working rules

Degen trading terminal (Solana-first). Every feature ships **one and done**: styled, fast, tested, pushed.

## How to work (save usage)
- Be brief with the owner. Report what changed, what was tested, what wasn't. No essays.
- Stay on the task asked. No side quests; note unrelated issues in one line.
- Read only what you need (grep first, then targeted reads). Batch independent commands.
- Push every finished change to **both** `main` and the session branch. The owner's machine runs
  `scripts/auto-pull.sh` on `main`, so Chrome updates on its own.

## Before every push (all must pass)
1. `cd frontend && CI=true yarn test --watchAll=false` → all green.
2. `cd frontend && CI=false npx craco build` → builds.
3. `PYTHONPATH=backend:. .venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -q` (plain `python` isn't on the owner's Mac) → all green (live-service tests may skip).
4. New mechanic ⇒ new test (fake the network; never hit mainnet or move funds).
5. UI change ⇒ open it (Playwright/Chromium is preinstalled) or say plainly that you didn't.

## Meta styling (no dead UI, ever)
- Palette: black/very dark green surfaces, live royal green `#19f58f` accent (matches the logo), `#ff8fa3` danger, `var(--gold)` warn.
  Labels/numbers in `JetBrains Mono`, uppercase micro-labels with letter-spacing.
- Every interactive element has hover, active and focus states. Selected = solid neon fill with dark text.
- Dropdowns, popovers and modals animate in (≤200ms, opacity + small translate/scale) and respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Scrollbars: thin neon thumb (`scrollbar-width:thin` + `::-webkit-scrollbar` 6px) or hidden when the
  content fits. Never the default grey bar. Review/confirm dialogs must fit without scrolling.
- Segmented controls instead of loose button rows; settings live behind the ⚙ panel, not on the card.
- Numbers: compact (`$4.4M`, `+12.3%`, huge moves as `12.4x`) and always show the $ value next to SOL.
- Day theme: every new surface gets a `body.theme-day` override.
- Build new UI from the `m-*` presets in `frontend/src/styles/meta.css` (m-card, m-label, m-num, m-chip, m-seg, m-btn,
  m-input, m-toggle, m-note, m-bars, m-kv). Big panels get `m-live` (drifting royal-green aurora + edge scan,
  2 pseudo-layers, never on list rows); primary buy/go buttons get `m-go` (deep→neon gradient, lift on hover). Add a preset there before writing one-off CSS. `styles/cssHygiene.test.js`
  fails on dead class rules and on legacy sheets growing past their KB budget; lower budgets when you delete CSS.

## One component per job
- Every coin chart is `components/terminal/TrenchChart.jsx` (toolbar, P&L badge, your trades on candles, Quick trade,
  Dip/Rip, rug shield). Trenches and the globe war room both use it; fix or extend it there, never fork a copy.
- Under the chart: `TradeTape` (live swaps, whales = ≥$1K and ≥5× median, 🔎 opens any wallet's case file). Room chart
  cards size by a `--chart-h` token per layout; nothing inside may be clipped in any layout or the floating window.
- Coins you hold: `lib/myHoldings.js` (`useHeld`, `HeldChip`), one shared poller of `/api/reputation/pnl/{address}`.
- One alert stream: every phone alert also goes to the wallet inbox via `notify(..., push=False)` with
  `meta.claim` + `meta.source`; push subscriptions carry `prefs.address`. Inbox lenses: All / Trading / Social.
- Swaps never auto-quote: the user picks coins + amount, then clicks Get quote (an open quote still refreshes every 10s).

## Speed (no lag)
- No request waterfalls: run independent lookups with `asyncio.gather` / parallel fetches.
- Hot JSON stores load via `_cached_json` / `_json_load` (parsed once per file version).
- Shared pollers for anything shown on many cards (`lib/pumpPulse.js`, `lib/snipersOut.js`), never one per card.
- Debounce typing (≤300ms); prefetch what the next click needs (quotes are pre-simulated).
- One pooled `httpx.AsyncClient` per service for outbound calls.
- Animate only transform/opacity. Never animate a custom property (`--ang` repaints every frame), never
  `backdrop-filter` over animated layers, no `filter: blur()` on moving layers. Heavy FX must die under `body.fx-lite`.
- Lag catcher (Cmd Ctr › Lag catcher) is the source of truth: fix its list before adding features. Full list: `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Money rules (trading)
- Engine: Jupiter Swap API primary (FEELESS fee into our SOL/USDC token accounts, capped priority,
  our broadcast). Ultra only as engine or opt-in fallback. Fallback off + Swap API down ⇒ trading pauses.
- Nothing trades fee-free except **buying** $FEE / FEECAT / rFEE. Coin→coin with no SOL/USDC side is refused.
- The wallet signs everything; the server verifies the signed message equals the quoted one; no resubmits.
- Only show or sign an order that matches the coins, side and amount on screen.

## Reputation / investigation
- `backend/investigate.py` is the scoring core (pure functions, tested): every score point is cited evidence
  (claim + source). Wallet cases, coin risk (mint/freeze authority, holders, forensics), funder clusters.
- `/api/reputation/case/{address}` builds a case for a wallet or a coin; the UI opens it anywhere via
  `investigate(address)` (`components/CaseFile.jsx`). Rug shield, radar and alerts must cite the same evidence.
- FEELESS wallets (`_protected_wallets`) can never be blocklisted or scored as suspects.

## Layout
- Helius key: `HELIUS_API_KEY` or `HELIUS_RPC_URL` (SOLANA_RPC_URL may point at another RPC).
- Backend services (restart all after backend changes: `bash scripts/start-backend.sh`):
  `server` 5001 (market + trading), `reputation_service` 5077 (social, fees, admin), `feecat_service` 5088, `candles_service` 5099.
- Frontend: CRA + craco on 51367. Styles mostly in `frontend/src/styles/terminal.css` (append scoped blocks).
- Command Center settings that matter at scale (keys, engine, fees) must be visible in its **Core** group.
