# FEELESS — working rules

Degen trading terminal (Solana-first). Every feature ships **one and done**: styled, fast, tested, pushed.

## How to work (save usage)
- Be brief with the owner. Report what changed, what was tested, what wasn't. No essays.
- Stay on the task asked. No side quests; note unrelated issues in one line.
- Read only what you need (grep first, then targeted reads). Batch independent commands.
- Push every finished change to **both** `main` and the session branch. The owner's machine runs
  `scripts/auto-pull.sh` on `main`, so Chrome updates on its own.

## Before every push (all must pass)
1. `cd frontend && CI=true yarn test --watchAll=false` → all green.
2. `cd frontend && CI=false npx craco build` → builds.
3. `PYTHONPATH=backend:. python -m pytest backend/tests -q` → all green (live-service tests may skip).
4. New mechanic ⇒ new test (fake the network; never hit mainnet or move funds).
5. UI change ⇒ open it (Playwright/Chromium is preinstalled) or say plainly that you didn't.

## Meta styling (no dead UI, ever)
- Palette: black/very dark green surfaces, neon `#00ffa3` accent, `#ff8fa3` danger, `var(--gold)` warn.
  Labels/numbers in `JetBrains Mono`, uppercase micro-labels with letter-spacing.
- Every interactive element has hover, active and focus states. Selected = solid neon fill with dark text.
- Dropdowns, popovers and modals animate in (≤200ms, opacity + small translate/scale) and respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Scrollbars: thin neon thumb (`scrollbar-width:thin` + `::-webkit-scrollbar` 6px) or hidden when the
  content fits. Never the default grey bar. Review/confirm dialogs must fit without scrolling.
- Segmented controls instead of loose button rows; settings live behind the ⚙ panel, not on the card.
- Numbers: compact (`$4.4M`, `+12.3%`, huge moves as `12.4x`) and always show the $ value next to SOL.
- Day theme: every new surface gets a `body.theme-day` override.

## Speed (no lag)
- No request waterfalls: run independent lookups with `asyncio.gather` / parallel fetches.
- Hot JSON stores load via `_cached_json` / `_json_load` (parsed once per file version).
- Shared pollers for anything shown on many cards (`lib/pumpPulse.js`, `lib/snipersOut.js`), never one per card.
- Debounce typing (≤300ms); prefetch what the next click needs (quotes are pre-simulated).
- One pooled `httpx.AsyncClient` per service for outbound calls.

## Money rules (trading)
- Engine: Jupiter Swap API primary (FEELESS fee into our SOL/USDC token accounts, capped priority,
  our broadcast). Ultra only as engine or opt-in fallback. Fallback off + Swap API down ⇒ trading pauses.
- Nothing trades fee-free except **buying** $FEE / FEECAT / rFEE. Coin→coin with no SOL/USDC side is refused.
- The wallet signs everything; the server verifies the signed message equals the quoted one; no resubmits.
- Only show or sign an order that matches the coins, side and amount on screen.

## Layout
- Backend services (restart all after backend changes: `bash scripts/start-backend.sh`):
  `server` 5001 (market + trading), `reputation_service` 5077 (social, fees, admin), `feecat_service` 5088, `candles_service` 5099.
- Frontend: CRA + craco on 51367. Styles mostly in `frontend/src/styles/terminal.css` (append scoped blocks).
- Command Center settings that matter at scale (keys, engine, fees) must be visible in its **Core** group.
